Ditches were dug in an effort to control lava flows, but by the 29th they were completely covered by lava. Authorities also tried to control the flows by having planes douse the lava with water, causing the flows to cool and stagnate, but they continued to travel down the volcano's flanks. Authorities stressed that the popular ski town of Linguaglossa (6,000 residents), located ~15 km NE of Etna's summit, was not in danger of being engulfed by lava flows. As a precautionary measure ~50 residents were evacuated and schools were closed. By the 28th lava flows had destroyed several hotels, restaurants, a ski school, ski lift pylons, and power lines on the volcano's flanks. Ash fell in towns at the base of the volcano.

According to news articles an eruption from Fogo's Pico cone inside the Cha Caldera began in the morning on 23 November after increased activity detected in the previous weeks and felt earthquakes by residents the night before. The eruption started at a vent on the WSW base of Pico cone, near or at where explosions originated in 1995, and then rose from multiple vents. The activity was characterized by explosions, lava fountains, and ash emissions. About 700 people evacuated from Chã das Caldeiras and the local airport closed. During the afternoon on 24 November workers removed items from the national park headquarters and by the evening lava had overtaken the building. Lava flows had crossed a main road and taken down communication poles. The Toulouse VAAC noted that a cloud observed in satellite images composed mainly of sulfur dioxide drifted over 220 km NW at an altitude of 9.1 km (30,000 ft) a.s.l. Ash in the cloud was detected at lower altitudes. By 25 November the lava flow was 4 km long. (reference #2432)\r\n<P>The eruption continues, but the situation is critical inside the Cha caldera. The northern lava flow branch has started to enter the village of Portela and today destroyed and/or damaged several buildings, including the headquarters of the Fogo Nature Park. The village, located at the northern end of the main road inside the caldera, is at risk of being cut off by lava flows... The eruption's heaviest economic damage is probably the destruction of vinyards in the area. The lava flows threaten the storage cellar with approx. 100,000 liters of wine.

In the Cha das Caldeiras region of the island, approximately 5,700 metres of Cha Sao Felipe road had been affected by lava flows, which has resulted in the Bangaeira, Djeu Lorna and Portela communities becoming cut off. Air traffic to and from the island was stopped. All of the people who lived in the crater of the volcano were evacuated by the National Civil Protection Service and Military and sought refuge ... The National Civil Protection Service reported that the lava flows had destroyed 230 buildings including homes and public infrastructure. It has also been reported that 444.7 hectares of land had been affected including 120 hectares of agricultural fields and livestock killed. In the Bangaeira and Portela communities, 100% of buildings had been destroyed...

The volcano, which sits less than 30 miles from the capital, Guatemala City, erupted just before noon Sunday and continued to spew ash, rocks and gas into the air. A second powerful eruption followed at 6:45 p.m. Some two million people were affected by the volcano's ash, which billowed 15,000 feet into the air and dispersed over a nine-mile radius.

Another says very considerable number of victims. (reference #9675)\r\n<P>In the first months of this year [1871], about February 16, earthquakes became very frequent; shortly after\r\nthe inhabitants of Mambajao and Catarman became convinced that the radiating center of the seismic disturbance was located in their little island, and not very far distant in the same mountain, whose fertile side, covered with verdure, had never been suspected of harboring a dangerous enemy... \r\n<P>On the 21st [Feb] at 4 oclock a. m. a violent earthquake shook the island, causing considerable\r\ndamage to the stone buildings. On the flank of the mountain the sight was dreadful. The rolling masses of stone were destroying trees and plantations, while the opening\r\nof fissures caused a noise like that of a great storm. The inhabitants of the town were terrified and from this moment began to escape in their boats to the neighboring\r\ncoasts of Mindanao and Bohol in search of safety...\r\n<P>During the months of March and April earthquakes succeeded one another with the same frequency and\r\nwere accompanied by effects identical with those just described... The inhabitants of the towns in the neighborhood of Mt. Catarman, with the exception of a few of the bolder spirits and some of the very poor, fled from their houses. Hence it is that when the eruption actually took place it found very few victims. \r\n<P>At last the shocks suddenly ceased. When day broke on April 30, at the foot of Mt. Catarman, which had been so shaken by the preceding earthquakes that it exposed its skeleton through the landslides and fissures, a column of thick vapor was seen rising up into the sky near the sea and about 400 yards distant from the town of Catarman. This column of vapor disappeared completely some hours afterwards. <P>At about 7 p. m. of the same day a tremendous explosion was heard in the direction of the above-mentioned spot, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke, which came from the same place. Everything roundabout\r\nwas set on fire. At the same time a shower of stones, earth, and ashes was vomited forth from the recently made openings. The ashes rose to a considerable height, spreading out and reaching Cebu and other islands 110 miles away. Within a radius of 2 miles from the new crater the destruction caused by the shower of fire, stones, earth,\r\nand ashes was almost complete; but fortunately there is no report of many human victims, evidently because the inhabitants of Catarman, which the destruction reached, had fled in due time to safer quarters. The eruption continued for six or seven days, after which the paroxysm died down, but the silent flowing of the semifluid lava continued,\r\nbuilding up a rough cone, which in two or three weeks' time\r\nmeasured some eight feet in height...\r\n<P>(above from reference #2070)", "DAMAGE_MILLIONS_DOLLARS": null, "DAMAGE_AMOUNT_ORDER": 3, "DAMAGE_DESCRIPTION": "Severe (~>$5 to $24 million)", "DEATHS": null, "DEATHS_AMOUNT_ORDER": 1, "DEATHS_DESCRIPTION": "Few (~1 to 50 people)", "INJURIES": null, "INJURIES_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "INJURIES_DESCRIPTION": null, "MISSING": null, "MISSING_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "MISSING_DESCRIPTION": null, "HOUSES_DESTROYED": null, "HOUSES_AMOUNT_ORDER": 3, "HOUSES_DESCRIPTION": "Many (~101 to 1000 houses)", "DAMAGE_MILLIONS_DOLLARS_TOTAL": null, "DAMAGE_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": 3, "DAMAGE_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": "Severe (~>$5 to $24 million)", "DEATHS_TOTAL": null, "DEATHS_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": 1, "DEATHS_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": "Few (~1 to 50 people)", "INJURIES_TOTAL": null, "INJURIES_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "INJURIES_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "MISSING_TOTAL": null, "MISSING_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "MISSING_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "HOUSES_DESTROYED_TOTAL": null, "HOUSES_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": 3, "HOUSES_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": "Many (~101 to 1000 houses)", "SIGNIF": 1, "VALIDITY": null, "NUM": "0701-08=", "NAME": "Camiguin", "LOCATION": "Mindanao-Philippines", "LATITUDE": 9.203, "LONGITUDE": 124.673, "ELEVATION": 1332, "MORPHOLOGY": "Stratovolcano", "STATUS": "Historical", "TIME_ERUPT": "D2", "ID": 70108, "COUNTRY": "Philippines", "NUM_SLIDES": 0, "SIG_ID": 2179, "TSU_ID": 1020, "HAZ_EVENT_ID": 679, "OBJECTID": 209 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 124.673000000000116, 9.203 ] } },

Around the time of peak harmonic tremor, in the early evening on 8 July, the Myrdalsjökull flood monitoring system indicated increased conduction. The water level reached the bridge around midnight and damaged the sensors. According to news articles, one new cauldron that had formed, along with cracks in the glacier around the cauldrons, may have been caused by a small eruption at Katla although no evidence of an eruption was observed. The jökulhlaup had destroyed a 128-m-long bridge and caused damage, resulting in the closing of part of the Ring Road. About 200 people were evacuated from the area but allowed to return home later that day. On 10 July the water had subsided and returned to normal levels.

BNPB reported that a major eruption occurred less than two hours later at 2250, followed by another large explosion at 2330. Ash plumes rose to an altitude of 17 km (55,800 ft) a.s.l. and caused ashfall in areas NE, NW, and W, as far as Pacitan (133 km WSW), Kulon Progo (236 km W), Temanggung (240 km WNW), and Banyuwangi (228 km E). Forty flights from the Juanda (81 km NE), Adi Sucipto Yogya (208 km W), and Adi Sumarmo Solo (175 km WNW) airports were cancelled. News articles reported that flights in and out of seven airports were cancelled or rerouted. Ashfall and tephra 5-8 cm in diameter caused structures to collapse, including schools, homes, and businesses.

Although recent population figures for the island are not available, the government estimates that more than 7,000 people, including the population of Manam and the smaller neighbouring island of Boisa, have been affected. The difference in the impact on Dangale and Kolang compared to the other affected villages was that they were destroyed by lava flow.

The volcano has erupted a number of times since then and spewed lava and ash last month. A series of tremors around Manam triggered a warning system on Monday and the volcano began erupting shortly after, the Rabaul Volcanological Observatory said. The eruption continued into early Tuesday, Ima Itikarai of the observatory told AFP. An observatory report said there were \"small ongoing eruptions\" from the main crater early Tuesday. Lava was channelled into a nearby valley and \"intermittent bursts\" of volcanic rock falling on villages, adding to a heightened risk of mudflows, it added.

That activity continued Saturday as new fissures and older ones continued their explosive lava flows, spitting out towering lava fountains that lit up the night sky and set off thunderous gas explosions that could be heard for miles around. On Friday evening, civil defense officials said a fast-moving lava flow had crossed Pohoiki Road and was threatening an isolated area with at least 40 homes. Since the eruptions started more than two weeks ago, some 22 fissures have opened in lower Puna, claiming at least 44 structures in the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions. Mandatory evacuations remain in place for the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions, home to about 2,000 people, but not everyone has heeded them and authorities haven't forced people to leave.(ref #12123)\r\n<P>The most recent  and 15th  fissure opened up Wednesday afternoon, generating a flow that traveled at least 66 feet. Hours later, 10 homes on Alaili Road  just outside of the subdivision  were evacuated because of worsening cracks on the highway. Some 36 structures have been destroyed, including 27 homes. Lava has covered more than 117 acres of land. At least nine roads are now impassable. As many as 50 utility poles have been damaged by the lava, and hundreds have been without power since the eruptions started. (ref #12135)\r\n<P>A stream of lava blocked a Hawaii highway on Sunday that serves as an escape route for coastal residents, while the first known serious injury was reported from fresh explosive eruptions from the Kilauea volcano. A homeowner on Noni Farms Road who was on a third-floor balcony had his leg shattered from his shin to his foot when hit by lava spatter, said Janet Snyder, a spokesperson for the Office of the Mayor, County of Hawaii. (ref #12147)\r\n<P>Civil defense officials have previously said about 2,000 residents in and around Leilani Estates were displaced at the outset of the current eruption, which began on May 3. But the total number of evacuees was estimated to have risen to about 2,500 after authorities ushered residents from the nearby Kapoho area as a precaution on Wednesday, as a lava flow threatened to cut off a key access road. At least 75 homes  most of them in Leilani Estates  have been devoured by streams of red-hot molten rock creeping from about two dozen large volcanic vents, or fissures, that have opened in the ground since Kilauea rumbled back to life four weeks ago.

In 338 Saka (that is, 416), a thunderous roar was heard from the bowels of Mount Ratuwara (also called Pulosari, an extinct volcano in the Banten region, the closest to the Sunda strait). This roar was answered by an identical roar from the bowels of Mount Kapi, which is situated west of the modern [region?] of Eanten. An enormous blinding flame, which reached the heavens, exploded from Kapi* Mountain. The whole world shook, Thunder pealed out, a storm burst, and it began to rain. However, the eruption of flame from Mount Kapi not only did not diminish with the rain , but even increased, The roar was terrifying. In the end, Mount Kapi exploded into pieces with a terrific noise and descended into the depths of the earth. A sea wave arose and inundated the land... After the water receded, Mount Kapi and its locality were left on the sea bottom, while Java Island split into two parts. Thus the islands of Sumatra and Java were separated. [The events are very similar to the famous eruption of Krakatau in 1883. It is possible that Mount Kapi is in fact the Krakatau Volcano.] \r\n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #2771:</i></blockquote> \r\n<P>According to ancient Japanese scriptures, the first known supercolossal eruption of Krakatau occurred in the year 416 A. D. - Some have reported it to occur in 535 A.D. The energy of this eruption is estimated to have been about 400 megatons of TNT, or the equivalent of 20,000 Hiroshima bombs. This violent early eruption destroyed the volcano,\r\nwhich collapsed and created a 7 km wide submarine caldera. The remnants of this earlier violent volcanic explosion were the three islands of Krakatau, Verlaten and Lang (Rakata, Panjang, and Sertung). Undoubtedly the 416 A.D. eruption/explosion/collapse generated a series of catastrophic tsunamis, which must have been much greater than those generated in 1883. The time of tsunami with wave height of several meters that affected Tamilnadu in\r\nIndia matches with this early Krakatau eruption. However, there are no other records to document the size of these early tsunamis or the destruction they caused. Subsequent to the 416 A.D. eruption and prior to 1883, three volcanic cones of Krakatau and at least one older caldera had combined again to form the island of Rakata. \r\n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #2432:</i></blockquote> \r\n<P>The renowned volcano Krakatau (frequently misstated as Krakatoa) lies in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra.

Photos and video posted in news articles showed tephra drifting E and blanketing the nearby hillside; JMA noted ashfall in Nakanojo-machi, in the Gunma Prefecture. Tephra hit a gondola, shattering glass and injuring four skiers. Material crashed through the roof of a lodge, where about 100 people had already been evacuated. Ground Self-Defense Force troops were engaging in ski training at the time of the event; one member died and seven others were injured. Emergency responders gathered at the Sanroku Station to assist. On 24 January JMA noted that volcanic earthquakes were numerous but decreasing in number, and two 2-3-minute-long periods of volcanic tremor were detected at 1015 and 1049.

(reference #9675)</p><p>Of the eruption in 1754, the greatest recorded in the history of Taal Volcano, we have likewise a description from the pen of worthy Fr. Buencuchillo, at the time stationed at Taal, of which narrative the following is an abridgement:</p><p>On May 15, 1754, at about 9 or 10 o&#39;clock in the night, the volcano quite unexpectedly commenced to roar and emit, sky-high, formidable flames intermixed with glowing rocks which, falling back upon the island and rolling down the slopes of the mountain, created the impression of a large river of fire. During the following days there appeared in the lake a large quantity of pumice stone which had been ejected by the volcano. Part of these ejecta had also reached the hamlet of Bayuyungan and completely destroyed it.</p><p>The volcano continued thus until June 2, during the night of which the eruption reached such proportions that the falling ejecta made the entire island appear to be on fire, and it was even feared that the catastrophe might involve the shores of the lake. From the said 2d of June until September 25, the volcano never ceased to eject fire and mud of such bad character that the best ink does not cause so black a stain.</p><p>During the night of September 25, the fire emitted was quite extraordinary and accompanied by terrifying rumblings. The strangest thing was, that within the black column of smoke issuing from the volcano ever since June 2, there frequently formed thunderstorms, and it happened that the huge tempest cloud would scarcely ever disappear during two months.</p><p>At daybreak of September 26 we found ourselves forced to abandon our dwelling for fear lest the roofs come down upon us under the weight of ashes and stones which had fallen upon them during that hapless night. In fact, some weaker buildings collapsed. The depth of the layer of ashes and stones exceeded two &#34;cuartas&#34; [45 centimeters or 18 inches], and the result was that there was neither tree nor other plant which it did not ruin or crush, giving to the whole region an aspect as if a devastating conflagration had swept over it. After this the volcano calmed down considerably, though not sufficiently to offer any prospect of tranquility.</p><p><strong>Twelve persons are known to have perished</strong>-some carried away by the waves of the lake, others crushed beneath their collapsing houses. Thus the beautiful town of Taal remains a deserted wilderness and reduced to the utmost misery, while once it was one of the richest and most flourishing places. In the villages to the west of the lake, which were the greater and better part, all the houses have either collapsed under the load of material which had been piled upon them or have disappeared completely, swept away by the waves which in these places were so violent that they dug three ditches or channels, too wide and deed to be forded, and thus rendered impassable the road which joins the town with Balayan. In other parts of the lake shore have likewise opened many cracks and occurred very extensive slides. The worst of all is, that, the mouth of the river Pansipit having been blocked, the lake is rising and invading the towns of Lipa and Tanauan, both being on the lowest level, and inundating their buildings. All the animals of whatever kind have perished, some by being buried, others by drowning, the rest by starving, as not a green blade remained anywhere.</p><p>(above from reference #2340)</p>", "DAMAGE_MILLIONS_DOLLARS": null, "DAMAGE_AMOUNT_ORDER": 4, "DAMAGE_DESCRIPTION": "Extreme (~$25 million or more)", "DEATHS": null, "DEATHS_AMOUNT_ORDER": 1, "DEATHS_DESCRIPTION": "Few (~1 to 50 people)", "INJURIES": null, "INJURIES_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "INJURIES_DESCRIPTION": null, "MISSING": null, "MISSING_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "MISSING_DESCRIPTION": null, "HOUSES_DESTROYED": null, "HOUSES_AMOUNT_ORDER": 4, "HOUSES_DESCRIPTION": "Very Many (~1001 or more houses)", "DAMAGE_MILLIONS_DOLLARS_TOTAL": null, "DAMAGE_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": 4, "DAMAGE_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": "Extreme (~$25 million or more)", "DEATHS_TOTAL": 12, "DEATHS_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": 1, "DEATHS_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": "Few (~1 to 50 people)", "INJURIES_TOTAL": null, "INJURIES_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "INJURIES_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "MISSING_TOTAL": null, "MISSING_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "MISSING_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "HOUSES_DESTROYED_TOTAL": null, "HOUSES_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": 4, "HOUSES_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": "Very Many (~1001 or more houses)", "SIGNIF": 1, "VALIDITY": null, "NUM": "0703-07=", "NAME": "Taal", "LOCATION": "Luzon-Philippines", "LATITUDE": 14.002, "LONGITUDE": 120.993, "ELEVATION": 400, "MORPHOLOGY": "Stratovolcano", "STATUS": "Historical", "TIME_ERUPT": "D1", "ID": 70307, "COUNTRY": "Philippines", "NUM_SLIDES": 0, "SIG_ID": 1328, "TSU_ID": 2853, "HAZ_EVENT_ID": 754, "OBJECTID": 532 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 120.993, 14.002 ] } },

The eruption was previously interpreted as phreatomagmatic (PHIVOLCS-DOST, 1991). We suggest an alternative interpretation of the phenomena as possibly Strombolian activity with lava fountaining and/or lava flow. Further, Father Gaspar de San Agustin made reference to damages to agricultural crops but did not describe dispersal or the extent of this damage. Saderra Maso and Worcester affirms the activity in AD1572 by the action of the first rector of the new town, Father Alburquerque, who performed mass at TVI in order to calm the fears of residents. Further affirmation of the eruption was made by Father Rada (identified as Father Nada by Worcester) when he recorded that Taal was in eruption in AD1572. The performance of a mass was the first show of the influence of religion in relation to an occurrence of a natural phenomenon at Taal Volcano and in the Philippines.

(reference #9675)\r\n<P>This increase in volcanic activity coincided with the  first microseismic movements registered in Manila at 20h20m of the 27th. It appears that the explosions began to assume a terrific violence at 1 o'clock in the morning of the 30th. Shortly after 2 a.m. the volcano burst forth with frightful energy. A terrible roar which seemed to be at the same time subterraneous and in the air and could be heard in all directions from the volcano up to distances exceeding 500 km. At the same time there was seen an immense, threatening, black cloud, crossed by brilliant flashes of lightning and illumined by local explosions resembling globular lightning, the whole accompanied by peals of thunder for the space of half an hour. This tempestuous cloud must have risen to an enormous height, since it was observed from distances of some 400 km. \r\n<P>The chief feature of the eruption seems to have been a terrible explosion which with incredible violence hurled high up into the air and scattered in all directions glowing rocks, earth, mud, ashes, and gases. ..this death-dealing mixture mowed down or destroyed whatever it encountered in its path on the entire island and on the neighboring western shores of Lake Bombon. It cut down or uprooted trees and other plants, destroyed houses, and killed well-nigh every living being within a radius of 5 to 6 km to the east of the crater, and up to more than 15 km to the west thereof. \r\n<P>Of the 1,300 victims who perished in the 13 small barrios-some on Volcano Island itself, others on the western shore-many were killed in the act of fleeing; others were found buried underneath or among the debris of their huts which had been brought down upon them and torn to pieces, being partially covered with rocks and mud; some\r\nseem to have been killed by instantaneous asphyxiation, as they were found on their mats in the attitude of peaceful sleep.\r\n<P>An idea of the condition in which this region was left by the eruption is given by the report of Col. William C. Rivers, Philippines Constabulary. In this report, written February 5, it is estimated that the number of victims had then already reached 1,295. We quote from it the following passages: The worst stricken district comprises Volcano Island and west side of lake. All vegetation, including trees, destroyed. Country all covered with gray mud hardening under sun present-uniform ashen color. Mud flattened and covers all houses and objects.\"\r\n<P>After returning to Manila on the completion of his special mission, Colonel Rivers presented a final report in which the total number of dead is given as 1,335, that of the injured as 199. This report contains the further statement that 543 nipa houses have been destroyed and 702 head of cattle either drowned or otherwise lost owing to the eruption; the material losses, exclusive of ruined crops, are estimated at F130,159.<P>\r\nThe exact number of victims will probably never be known-first, because the waves have carried away many corpses and, no doubt, buried others beneath earth, trunks of\r\ntrees, and other debris, which filled up many depressions in the ground; secondly, because some have surely met their doom while fleeing toward the jungle, where their bones\r\nremained more or less completely buried by the volcanic ashes. Moreover, the number of people who inhabited these regions is by no means known accurately, as they were in the\r\nhabit of passing from one village to another according to their convenience in attending to their crops.\r\n<P>(above from reference #2340)\r\n<P>1911, Jan 30.

(ref #1686)</p><p>On Aug 11, 1749, began one of the most violent outbursts of Taal on record. It has been described by Fr. Buencuchillo, 0. S. A,, an eye-witness, since he was at the time parish-priest of Sala. During the night of that day the top of the mountain burst out with tremendous force from the same crater which since ancient times used to emit fire and rocks. The course of events was this:</p><p>At about 11 o&#39;clock of the night I had noticed a rather extensive glare over the top of the island; but entirely unaware of what this might portent, I paid no special attention to it and retired to rest. Around 3 o&#39;clock in the morning of the 12th, I heard something like heavy artillery fire and began to count the reports, taking it for granted that they came from the ship which was expected to arrive from New Spain [Mexico] and which, according to an ancient custom, on entering Balayan Bay saluted Our Lady of Caysasay. I thought it strange, however, when I found that the number of detonations already exceeded one hundred, and still they did not cease. This caused me to rise with some anxiety as to what could be the matter; but my doubts were quickly dispelled, as at this moment there appeared four excited natives who shouted: &#34;Father, let us leave this place! The volcano has burst out and all this noise and racket comes from it!&#34;</p><p>By this time it began to dawn, and we saw the immense column of smoke which rose from the summit of the island, while several smaller whiffs issued from other openings. I confess that the spectacle, far from frightening me, rather delighted my eyes, especially when I noticed that also from the water there arose enormous columns of sand and ashes, which ascended in the shape of pyramids to marvelous heights and then fell back into the lake like illuminated fountains.</p><p>...During my flight I saw a great many tall trees, such as coconut and betel-nut palms, either miserably fallen, or so deeply buried that their tops were within reach of my hands. I likewise saw several houses which formerly, in accordance with Philippine custom, had their floors raised several yards above ground, but had sunk to such a degree that the same ladder which once served to ascend into them, was now used to descend to them. The most remarkable thing about this is that the natives tranquilly continue occupying them, though they find themselves buried alive.</p><p>It rained ashes in considerable quantity and that part of them which remained suspended in the air, formed a vast cloud which grew so dense as to cause real darkness during the hours of broad daylight.</p><p>Fr. Murillo states in his &#34;Geografia Historica, etc.,&#34; that he was at the time at the Sanctuary of Antipolo which lies 21 km almost due east from Manila. During the eruption he felt three or four earthquakes of such violence that the roof tiles of the tower were thrown to a distance of more than 10 meters. Of less intense shocks there were more than one hundred, and the earth trembled frequently during more than a year. There were likewise fierce thunderstorms during many days.</p><p>(above from ref #2340)</p>", "DAMAGE_MILLIONS_DOLLARS": null, "DAMAGE_AMOUNT_ORDER": 1, "DAMAGE_DESCRIPTION": "Limited (<$1 million)", "DEATHS": null, "DEATHS_AMOUNT_ORDER": 1, "DEATHS_DESCRIPTION": "Few (~1 to 50 people)", "INJURIES": null, "INJURIES_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "INJURIES_DESCRIPTION": null, "MISSING": null, "MISSING_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "MISSING_DESCRIPTION": null, "HOUSES_DESTROYED": null, "HOUSES_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "HOUSES_DESCRIPTION": null, "DAMAGE_MILLIONS_DOLLARS_TOTAL": null, "DAMAGE_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": 3, "DAMAGE_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": "Severe (~>$5 to $24 million)", "DEATHS_TOTAL": null, "DEATHS_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": 1, "DEATHS_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": "Few (~1 to 50 people)", "INJURIES_TOTAL": null, "INJURIES_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "INJURIES_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "MISSING_TOTAL": null, "MISSING_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "MISSING_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "HOUSES_DESTROYED_TOTAL": null, "HOUSES_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": 3, "HOUSES_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": "Many (~101 to 1000 houses)", "SIGNIF": 1, "VALIDITY": 4, "NUM": "0703-07=", "NAME": "Taal", "LOCATION": "Luzon-Philippines", "LATITUDE": 14.002, "LONGITUDE": 120.993, "ELEVATION": 400, "MORPHOLOGY": "Stratovolcano", "STATUS": "Historical", "TIME_ERUPT": "D1", "ID": 70307, "COUNTRY": "Philippines", "NUM_SLIDES": 0, "SIG_ID": 1304, "TSU_ID": 431, "HAZ_EVENT_ID": 753, "OBJECTID": 532 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 120.993, 14.002 ] } },

These effects were not restricted to Sumbawa as famine and disease brought about by the eruption was severe on distant islands as well. On Lombok, estimates of the death toll ranged from 44,000 to 100,000 and on Bali at least 25,000. A conservative number of deaths from the eruption and subsequent famine and disease is 117,000.<p>The eruption emitted large quantities of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere which caused 1816 to be termed \"the  year without summer.\" As average temperatures fell 1 to 2.5 degrees C below normal throughout New England and western Europe.<P>News of this distant eruption in Indonesia did not reach the Western world for some time, but unusual atmospheric phenomena and climate deterioration set in during 1816\"the year without summer.\" ...Tambora-size (ca 100 km3 of magna) explosive volcanic eruptions emit large quantities of sulfur dioxide gas into the stratosphere, where it is converted into a sulfuric acid aerosol dust veil that encircles the Earth. The aerosol has the effect of reducing solar heat reaching the surface of the planet, leading to global cooling. Strange atmospheric phenomena had been observed in Europe before the summer of 1816. In May 1815 the sunsets in England were exceptionally colorful, and by September the sky seemed to be on fire every evening. But the spectacular skies brought bad weather the following year, and the year 1816 is the worst on record in Europe, with the mean temperature about 3 deg C below average across the entire continent from Britain in the north to Tunisia in the south. In England the summer was miserable, with the mean temperature for June the lowest on record, or 12.9 deg C. In France it was so cold that the wine harvest was later than at any time since record keeping began--delayed until November in those districts where the grapes were not already frozen on the vine. In Germany crops failed, a situation exacerbated by the war with Napoleon, and famine and price inflation were widespread. Conditions in Germany became so intolerable that people in many districts rioted and set off in search of better living conditions, starting the great migration from northern Europe east to Russia and west to America. The severe weather in fact led to crop failure of all the major crops in Europe and doubling of the price of wheat from 1815 to 1817. When we consider than in the early part of the 19th century agriculture was the mainstay of society, it is clear that the climate change had a strong impact on the economy of the western world. <P><blockquote><i>Reference #2432:</i></blockquote> <P>VEI 7, Tephra Volume: 1.6x 10<sup>11</sup> m<sup>3</sup>. \r\n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #9675</i></blockquote> \r\nApproximately 11,000 direct deaths from bomb impacts, tephra falls, and tsunamis; recent work indicates pyroclastic flows reached all but W coast and probably caused most direct fatalities on Sumbawa.\r\n<P>Indirect effects: An estimated 49,000 persons died of famine and disease on Sumbawa and Lombok islands following the eruption.

Communities in the northwestern and southern parts of Ambae have been worst affected with reports of buildings and trees collapsing under the weight of the ash. Water supplies have also been contaminated and food gardens smothered.

The population returned to their island on the 22 October 2017 after three weeks living in evacuation centres and camps. As of the 8 April, due to a change in wind direction, the North and some parts in the East of Ambae begun reporting heavy ash fall that they described as worse than any other ash fall in the past. Houses, other structures and trees have collapsed under the weight of the ash. Food gardens have been destroyed and water sources contaminated. Furthermore, large fallen trees have blocked road access to some communities in the North, while dangerous landslides believed to be linked to the heavy deposits of ashfall have since destroyed an entire village. The SOE also came with indication of the plan by the National government to assist with voluntary evacuations up until 30 April. After this, they will implement mandatory evacuations over a 2-week period until 15 May.

Ruins of the temple of the Sun Goddess Dhat Ba'dan suggest that the site was burnt down, probably by this eruption. This temple is located a few hundred metres southeast of al-Huqqa (Bait al-Haqr) which, according to an inscription, was still in use in AD 200.

On Sangihe Is, after a sudden \"unbearable\" roar, the Awu Volcano began to erupt. Incandescent lava rushed down the slopes of the mountain with irresistible force, destroying everything in its path. Where the lava reached the shore, the sea water began to boil. Strong hot springs gushed up and the abundant surging boiling water destroyed and carried away everything that the fire had spared. \r\n<P>The sea surged onto the shore cliffs as during an underwater earthquake, and with a terrifying noise, it flooded the coast and \"snatched its victims from the fire.\"\r\n<P>An hour later, thunderous blows were heard, shaking the earth. A black column of ash and stones was ejected from the peak of the mountain. The column rose to the \"heavens\" and fell in a rain of fire on the slopes of the volcano, which were lit up by the red hot lava. Total darkness\r\nfell, in which one could not make out the closest objects; it was interrupted from time to time by outbreaks of light. Large bombs fell to the earth. The settlements and field s not destroyed by the lava were buried under a layer of ash and rocks. The flows rushed down from the mountain, and, encountering obstacles, spread out in lakes, which then became a new source of destruction.<P>All this took several hours. By midnight, all had quieted down, although the eruption began with new force the next noon. The ashfall continued all day and was so intensive that no light could penetrate, and almost total darkness set in.<P>A hurricane southeastern wind blew since the beginning of the eruption, and the ashes were carried as far as Mindanao Island. Later the wind blew from the north.<P>On March 17, there was a new eruption, in which fields and trees on the coast at Tabukan were destroyed. After this, the volcano quieted down, except that steam continuously rose from the numerous cracks and fractures. However, the lava flows were still so hot that one could not approach them. According to residents, the top of the volcano did not change noticeably in appearance.<P>At the main village of the island, Tahuna, several people were injured and homes were destroyed during the fall of ash and stones. Obstacles in the form of hills made the lava flow deviate from the village and turn to the sea in another place.<P>Along the flat slope between Tahuna and Kandhar, seven large lava flows descended to the sea, devastating this agricultural region. One of the flows passed through Kalongan village; only a few burned posts were left. Between Kalongan and Kandhar, a large area of the coast subsided below sea level. The mountain side had previously sloped gently to the very water line; after the eruption, it broke off as a steep wall about 60 m (200 feet) high.<P>The settlement of Kandhar, protected by this \"rib,\" suffered little: it was affected only by the fall of ashes and stones and the streams of hot water. In addition, before the eruption, the residents, fearing pirates, had hidden with their belongings in the thickets above the settlement, and did not suffer from the flooding.<P>The devastation was even greater on the coast from Kandhar to the northern tip of the island. Two tongues of lava thrust far into the sea to previous bottom marks of several metres (fathoms).<P>The number of victims was considerable: at Tahuna 722, at Kandhar 22, at Tabukan 2,039; total 2,806. For the most part, the people died in the gardens where they sought relief  from the heat.

The eruption was preceded by an hour-long period of volcano-tectonic events followed by long-period events; no increases in seismicity had been noted since 2009 when real-time seismic monitoring started. After a large seismic event detected at 1735, a 90 minute eruption generated a sub-Plinian, gray ash plume that rose 15 km above the main crater and drifted mainly ENE, although fine ash drifted N and NW. Column collapses occurred locally and radially, affecting the headwaters of major rivers. Residents within the exclusion zone, in Chamiza, Lago Chapo, and Correntoso sectors, and in the town of Puerto Montt, were ordered to evacuate. Several roads and bridges were impassable due to ashfall. A larger second event on 23 April began at 0100, lasted six hours, and also generated a sub-Plinian ash plume that rose higher than 15 km and drifted N, NE, and E. About 5,000 people had been evacuated and ONEMI warned people not to go within 200 m of drainages due to lahar hazards. News articles noted that international flights in and out of several major cities were delayed or canceled. <B>Some houses in areas near the volcano collapsed from the weight of the ash</B>. ONEMI noted on 27 April that 246 of 4,514 evacuees were in shelters; the number of displaced people had peaked at 6,514 during 24-26 April. (reference #11206)\r\n<P>Last week's spectacular twin eruptions of the Calbuco volcano will cost southern Chile's Los Lagos region, a tourism and agriculture hub, up to $600 million, a local business leader said Monday. The region is struggling to clean up some 210 million cubic meters (7.4 billion cubic feet) of ash spewed by the volcano, which contaminated rivers, lakes and vast stretches of prairie. \"The Los Lagos regional economy had annual turnover of $2 billion. We estimate the eruption of Calbuco will cause losses of up to about 30 percent,\" he said. Los Lagos has more than a million head of cattle, around 30 percent of the total in Chile, and supplies about half the South American country's milk. Chile's salmon industry, the world's second-largest, is also facing losses. Los Lagos has the largest concentration of salmon farms in the country, but many had their water supplies contaminated by ash.The effect on the region's key tourism industry, which draws about 200,000 visitors a year, is less clear. \"The volcano could decrease the number of tourists coming for outdoors activities... but it could also increase the number of tourists who want to see an active volcano,\" said Jadue.

According to Minh Do su (Minh's Dynasty Historical Book), Vol. 23, the volcanos eruptions and related shaking are described as: \"Earthquakes were followed by roars sounded like thunders, the sea waters shot highly in the air during many days in the Phu Qui island, sometimes 4-5 times, sometimes 20-30 times a day\". P.V. Thuc (2008) described activities of volcanos and earthquakes in the coastal zones of Central Vietnam as follows: \"Before eruptions, starting from 15/02/1923 many places of Phan Theit, Cu lao Hon island were strongly shook, houses tilted, people could not stand but sea level did not disturb. The shakings lasted a week, and then when the Japanese ship Vacasamuru passed by, they observed a black column of smoke and a dense column of gaz of more than 2000 m height coupled with blasting sounds\". Based on hydrohtermal and C14 data analysis, the authors conclude that the magma of the Hon Tro volcano was erupted from a depth of 60-70 km.

Along the entire south coast of the island and in the interior, numerous collapses, slides,and rock falls took place. In Wood Valley between Kapapala and Pahala, a mud flow came down. It was 5 1/2 km long, 1 km wide at the middle and 2 km wide at the head, with an average thickness of 2 m, up to 6, 9 and 12 m in places, such as in depressions of the relief. It covered a village of 10 homes; 31 people died. In the basalt sheets west of Waiohinu, a crack was formed, along which a horizontal shift occurred. Cracks also developed at other places.

Mayon volcano's torrent of ash, lava, and volcanic rock particles. In a statement on Sunday, Ricardo Jalad, head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, said that the number of Albay residents hit by disease due to ashfall from Mt. Mayon has almost quadrupled, from 516 to 1,972. The agency also reported the ash, lava and pyroclastic materials spewed by the volcano over the past two weeks have damaged 189.4 million Philippines pesos ($3.72 million) worth of crops in the Albay province, including rice, corn, and abaca. (ref #12002)\r\n<P>PHIVOLCS reported that during 16-17 January Mayons seismic network recorded 143 lava collapse events associated with rockfalls along the front and margins of advancing lava and pyroclastic flows in the Miisi (S), Matanag (SE), and Buyuan (SE) drainages. These events generated ash plumes that drifted SW. During 17-20 January effusion of lava at the summit and collapse events continued. Two pyroclastic flows traveled around 3 km down the Miisi drainage. Rockfall events were generated by the collapsing lava front and margins of the advancing 3-km-long lava flow in the Miisi drainage, and from the summit into the Matanag, Buyuan, and Bonga (SE) drainages. Ash plumes continued to drift SW. Sulfur dioxide gas emissions were 1,478 tonnes/day on 18 January and 1,131 tonnes/day on 19 January. During 20-21 January there were 14 rockfall events and 10 pyroclastic flows recorded by the seismic network. \r\nDuring 21-22 January there were 64 rockfall events and one pyroclastic flow recorded. Strombolian activity generated lava fountains 500 and 200 m high at 1045 on 21 January and at 0225 on 22 January, respectively. Ash plumes rose 1.3 km high and drifted SW, causing ashfall in Oas and Guinobatan (12 km SW). Lava flowed more voluminously, adding to the advancing Miisi lava flow (over 3 km long) and feeding two new lava flows on the Bonga and upper Buyuan drainages. \r\nAt 1243 on 22 January an eight-minute-long phreatomagmatic event generated a dense, 5-km-high ash plume that drifted W. Ashfall was reported in the municipalities of Guinobatan, Camalig (11 km SSW), Oas, Polangui (20 km WNW), and Iriga City (34 km NW). The event also generated pyroclastic flows that traveled as far as 4 km down multiple drainages including Miisi, Bonga, Buyuan, Basud, San Andres, Buang, Anoling. PHIVOLCS raised the Alert Level to 4 (on a 0-5 scale) and extend the Danger Zone to an 8-km radius. A minor event at 1725 produced a 500-m-high ash plume. Between 2137 on 22 January and 0525 on 23 January there were five episodes of intense and sporadic lava fountaining, each lasting 3-30 minutes. The lava fountains rose 500-700 m high, and generated ash plumes that rose 2.5-3 km above the crater. The events fed lava flows on the Miisi and Bonga drainages, sprayed near-vent lava spatter, and fed incandescent rockfalls around the summit area. The Buyuan lava flow was 200 m long. According to news articles posted on 23 January about 40,000 people have been evacuated, and airports in the cities of Legazpi City (13 km SSE) and Naga (66 km NW), and on the nearby island of Masbate (100 km S) were closed.

An underwater volcano erupted in the vicinity of the Manua Islands. The first indications of it were weak shocks, felt on September 7 by the inhabitants of the islands of Tau and Olosega, which are part of that archipelago. These shocks occurred at an average of four per hour, and the vibrations continued into the following day. Thirty-nine shocks occurred during the night of September 9. \r\n<P>After dinner on the 12th a disturbance in the sea commenced at a distance of approximately 3 km (1 1/2 miles) from the island of Olosega and 8 km (4 1/2 miles) from the island of Tau...The destruction continued all that day and through part of the next. This was followed by an underwater eruption with its usual manifestations. On the 15th of September the eruption was repeated, and each hour approximately 50 eruptions occurred...During this time large pieces of lava floated up to the surface of the ocean, and tremors were felt on the islands. A column of thick smoke, rising to a height of about 600 m (2,000 ft), completely darkened the sky. \r\n<P>Although the eruption did not reveal open flames, gleams of fire could be observed on two or three occasions. The sea was extremely disturbed and for a distance of 20 km (10 miles) glittered with a phosphorescent light. Many dead fish floated to the surface and were cast upon the shore.\r\n<P>After three days, the frequency of the eruptions began to abate, although even on the 11th of November three or four explosions per hour could be counted. The products of the eruption were not thrown up to such a significant height as previously, now no higher than 5-10 m (20-30 feet). The condition of the vegetation on the Manua Islands suggests that this area had not seen very severe eruptions for at least 80-100 years. \r\n<P>(above from reference #415).\r\n<P>Start Date: 1866 Sep 12, Stop date: 1866 Nov 15 ± 5 days.

This could refer to the birth of Cone A, but since Hantke offers no additional information or references to support this notion, the report is apocryphal at best. It is intriguing to note that eruptions are also reported at Vsevidof, on the southwestern end of Umnak Island, in 1817, 1830, and 1878 (Miller et al., 1998). Of particular interest is the suggestion by Miller et al. that the 1878 activity of Vsevidof 'may have been from a radial fissure eruption on the west flank; this event may have produced the youngest dacite flow, which extends west-southwest to Cape Kigushimkada.' Such a fissure eruption would probably produce earthquakes and could account for Hantke's 'new crater,' though not located inside a caldera. <b>It is thus possible that Hantke misinterpreted the location of the 1878 activity, and there may not have been an eruption at Okmok in that year at all.</b>\" \r\n<P>Sapper (1917), compiling information from Petroff (1884) and Fuchs, reports \"a brief flame and ash eruption and a new crater developed from which came steam and hot cooking mud. This new crater appeared between Vsevidof and the settlement.\" This statement seems to support Miller et al.'s (1998) assertion that <b>there was a radial fissure eruption at Vsevidof in 1878</b>. \r\n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #2432:</i></blockquote> \r\n<P>Confirmed eruption of Okmok in 1878. VEI: 2. The broad, basaltic Okmok shield volcano, which forms the NE end of Umnak Island, has a dramatically different profile than most other Aleutian volcanoes. The summit of the low, 35-km-wide volcano is cut by two overlapping 10-km-wide calderas formed during eruptions about 12,000 and 2050 years ago that produced dacitic pyroclastic flows that reached the coast. More than 60 tephra layers from Okmok have been found overlying the 12,000-year-old caldera-forming tephra layer. Numerous satellitic cones and lava domes dot the flanks of the volcano down to the coast, including 1253-m Mount Tulik on the SE flank, which is almost 200 m higher than the caldera rim. \r\n<P>Some of the post-caldera cones show evidence of wave-cut lake terraces; the more recent cones, some of which have been active historically, were formed after the caldera lake, once 150 m deep, disappeared. Hot springs and fumaroles are found within the caldera. Historical eruptions have occurred since 1805 from cinder cones within the caldera.\r\n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #3789:</i></blockquote> \r\n<P>Historic accounts of the 1878 event do not clearly document the primary source of the reported phenomena.

The overflow of Maughan Lake, the crater lake at Parker volcano, followed heavy rains associated with a passing typhoon and caused flash flooding in NW-flank communities on 6 September. A team from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) was dispatched to determine whether the overflow was caused by volcanic activity.

By Aug 20, mudflows had killed more than 100. Disease at evacuation camps had (by Sept 20) brought the total fatalities to about 800. \r\n<blockquote>Reference #2432</blockquote>\r\nPrior to 1991 Pinatubo volcano was a relatively unknown, heavily forested lava dome complex located 100 km NW of Manila with no records of historical eruptions. The 1991 eruption, one of the world's largest of the 20th century, ejected massive amounts of tephra and produced voluminous pyroclastic flows, forming a small, 2.5-km-wide summit caldera whose floor is now covered by a lake. Caldera formation lowered the height of the summit from 1745 to 1486 m. Although the eruption caused hundreds of fatalities and major damage with severe social and economic impact, successful monitoring efforts greatly reduced the number of fatalities. Widespread lahars that redistributed products of the 1991 eruption have continued to cause severe disruption.\r\n<P>March 1991. The press reported that an explosion on 2 April deposited ash over an area of about 10,000 m2, including part of one village, and that about 2,000 people were evacuated. No injuries or deaths were reported. PHIVOLCS confirmed the explosion, and later noted a SW-NE-trending line of new vents extending 0.5-1.0 km on the N side of the volcano. The vents continued to emit a gas plume 200-500 m high as of mid-April. Observers at Clark Air Force Base (~15 km E) reported sulfurous odors. A seismic net, installed following the 2 April explosion, recorded increasing seismicity, reaching 135 earthquakes on 15 April.\r\n<P>April 1991. On 2 April, an explosion at the E end of Pinatubo's geothermal area (about 1.5 km NW of the summit and 2/3 of the way down the flank) ejected clouds of steam and minor quantities of ash to 500-800 m height. Ash fell 2 km away, primarily to the NW and SW, and covered an area of about 10,000 m2, including part of one village, from which about 2,000 people were evacuated. No injuries or deaths were reported. \r\n<P>May-June 1991. After more than 2 months of increasing seismicity, deformation, and emission of small plumes, a series of strong explosions culminated in one of the largest eruptions of this century. The 15-16 June climactic phase lasted more than 15 hours, sending tephra to 30 km altitude, generating voluminous pyroclastic flows, and leaving a small caldera in the former summit region. Ten days later, the aerosol cloud formed a nearly continuous band that stretched 11,000 km from Indonesia to Central Africa. Timely evacuations saved many lives, but the combined effects of the eruption and a typhoon killed more than 300 people.\r\n<blockquote>Reference #11546</blockquote>\r\nBy early June [1991], officials called for the evacuation of 25,000 people living in the area, including American service people at Clark Air Base and the U.S. Naval Station at Subic Bay. \"By June 14 the recommended evacuation radius was 30 kilometers, which would have applied to perhaps 400,000 people,\" Newhall said. Never before had such a widespread evacuation attempt been made before a volcanic eruption. By the time the volcano erupted on 15 June, scientists and public officials had convinced more than 65,000 people to evacuate. More than 350 died during the eruption, but USGS and PHIVOLCS estimate that evacuation efforts saved between 5000 and 20,000 lives.\r\n<blockquote>Reference #11542</blockquote\r\n>The eruption of Mt Pinatubo In June 1991 caused the largest perturbation this century to the particulate content of the stratosphere.

There was an eruption of the Raluan and\r\nTawurwur Volcanoes in Blanche Bay. The eruption was accompanied at different stages by oscillations of the water level in the bay.<P>The first strong earthquake struck on May 28 at about 13:20. It lasted half a minute and reached a force of 7 degrees (VIII Rossi-Forel)... On May 29, at about 5:30, a new shock was felt at Rabaul... Between 8:00 and 9:00, an elevation of Kaluan Is was observed... \r\n<P>The eruption of the volcano began at 16:15 [May 29]. The island and the adjacent sections of bottom began to rise quickly; the little islands in the passage began to grow and merge, and soon a broad isthmus formed between the island and the mainland. Then the volcano exploded, and a black pillar of ash and steam 9 m wide and 12 m high rose into the air. The column grew with each subsequent explosion, and reached a height of 3 km. Masses of flames the size of a room or smaller flew up to a height of 1.5 km and then fell to the earth or into the water with A deafening noise. There were no lava flows.\r\n<P>The eruption of the volcano lasted more than 24 hrs. According to rough estimates, it ejected 0.3 cubic km of material, which spread in the form of ash, mainly to the northwest of the volcano due to the prevailing southeast winds; 60,000,000 cubic m of fresh material was deposited immediately around the volcano under water and 190,000,000 cubic m was deposited above the water level. The height of the island increased from 9 to 200 m. Fields of pumice and ash 1/2 m thick floated in the bay.\r\n<P>The eruption of the Tawurwur Volcano began on May 30, after 13:00. The eruption lasted until the morning of the following day; about 2,300,000 cubic m of material was ejected. It also settled to the northwest of the volcano, that is, in the region of Rabaul, where the layer of ash was several cm thick.\r\n<P>During the first explosions of the Raluan Volcano, the underground shocks for the most part stopped. The water near Raluan Is was markedly agitated. At Rabaul, the water retreated 45 m several times, returned to the high high tide mark, and retreated again. Then the eruption was almost continuous for 3 hrs, but there were no noticeable oscillations in level.\r\n<P>Beginning at 19:00, the eruption began to pulsate, and periods of explosions began to alternate with periods of relative calm. It was precisely, during such a period of calm and before 21:00, that is, before the lip of the new crater of the volcano had completely risen above the water, that considerable oscillations in level were observed in the harbor. Four to five minutes passed between the rise and fall of the water. The amplitude of at least three of these waves was 2-2 1/2 m above and below the mean water level. A schooner was run aground by the wave onto a small pier and then dragged to the depths of the bay together with the pier. Several boats ran aground, and one or two sank. Subsequently, the oscillations apparently diminished, but their range was still 1/2 m early in the morning on the 30th.\r\n<P> During the eruption, <B>more than 500 people perished, including those who drowned</B>.

Bits of masonry were scattered around for a distance of up to 100 m, so that only the remaining paved courtyard indicated the previous site of the church. The earth was furrowed with ditches, carved out by the retreating water. The trees were uprooted and strewn helter-skelter with debris of homes and various utensils.

The towns of Palmer, San Felipe, Coombia, and Centepee, are all ruined. Ashes are 7 ft. deep in the tineas and towns. Mud, stones, and lava have fallen all over the country. Houses have been crushed by the weight of the volcanic material that has fallen upon them. Retalhuleu, Mazatenango, and Quezaltenango have not suffered so much, but this calamity is only beginning. We have mud and ashes in Retalhuleu. There is great loss of life. Cattle and horses are dead by thousands. Famine and pest are approaching. God help us! Bridges and roads have been destroyed. It is impossible to get further news.\r\n<P>LIVES REPORTED LOST.<br>It is the common belief in all the coast towns of Central America that thousands of lives have been sacrificed in this awful disaster. Those who have come in from the region immediate to the zone of devastation insist that all who were in the towns of Pilmar, San Felipe, Colombia, and Coatepee must have perished. <P>LOSS REACHES MILLIONS.<br>The property losses are enormous. The estimates of these losses are in varying millions. The coffee fincas of the Western Department of Guatemala were among the most productive and profitable in the world. On October 31 advices were received in this city to the effect that the entire coffee zone of Guatemala had been destroyed, and that the lives of all engaged on the fincas and living in the towns and villages were in imminent danger. Later information not only confirms these first reports, but greatly enlarges the area of destruction and vastly increases the amount of loss to the coffee planters. <P>AN OFFICIAL REPORT.<br>Mr. James C. McNally, United States Consul-General at Guatemala City, in his official report to the State Department, estimates the total loss at more than £1,000,000. He says ;  \"As a climax to the terrible earthquakes of April 18, which practically compassed the ruin of Quezaltenango, the volcano Santa Maria, almost adjoining that city, erupted on October 24, throwing out quantities of mud and ashes, causing untold damage on the coast side, which comprises the rich coffee zone of Guatemala. The volcano is still active, and ashes are falling on places 30 miles distant from the crater.\" <P>FIFTEEN THOUSAND PERSONS DEAD.<BR>Mr. Hans Lang left here six weeks ago to assume the position of assistant manager of the plantation of Lucerno, near Osuna. In speaking of the loss of life resulting from the eruption, Mr. Lang said:--\"In Guatemala City it was estimated that 15,000 lives were lost. The exact number will never be known, as thousands lie buried beneath the ashes, and their bodies will never be recovered. I was stationed fifty miles from Santa Maria, and no ashes fell on my plantation, although the rumblings were distinctly heard and the lightning flashes plainly seen. When the volcano of Fuego, adjacent to the plantation, began to belch forth smoke, I thought it time to decamp, so I made my way to Guatemala City.", "DAMAGE_MILLIONS_DOLLARS": null, "DAMAGE_AMOUNT_ORDER": 2, "DAMAGE_DESCRIPTION": "Moderate (~$1 to $5 million)", "DEATHS": 2500, "DEATHS_AMOUNT_ORDER": 4, "DEATHS_DESCRIPTION": "Very Many (~1001 or more people)", "INJURIES": null, "INJURIES_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "INJURIES_DESCRIPTION": null, "MISSING": null, "MISSING_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "MISSING_DESCRIPTION": null, "HOUSES_DESTROYED": null, "HOUSES_AMOUNT_ORDER": 2, "HOUSES_DESCRIPTION": "Some (~51 to 100 houses)", "DAMAGE_MILLIONS_DOLLARS_TOTAL": null, "DAMAGE_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": 2, "DAMAGE_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": "Moderate (~$1 to $5 million)", "DEATHS_TOTAL": 10000, "DEATHS_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": 4, "DEATHS_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": "Very Many (~1001 or more people)", "INJURIES_TOTAL": null, "INJURIES_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "INJURIES_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "MISSING_TOTAL": null, "MISSING_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "MISSING_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "HOUSES_DESTROYED_TOTAL": null, "HOUSES_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": 2, "HOUSES_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": "Some (~51 to 100 houses)", "SIGNIF": 1, "VALIDITY": 4, "NUM": "1402-03=", "NAME": "Santa Maria", "LOCATION": "Guatemala", "LATITUDE": 14.756, "LONGITUDE": -91.552, "ELEVATION": 3772, "MORPHOLOGY": "Stratovolcano", "STATUS": "Historical", "TIME_ERUPT": "D1", "ID": 140203, "COUNTRY": "Guatemala", "NUM_SLIDES": 0, "SIG_ID": null, "TSU_ID": null, "HAZ_EVENT_ID": 3521, "OBJECTID": 1438 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -91.552, 14.756 ] } },

Dio Cassius dates it Roman year 800 (AD 47), while St Jerome gives the fifth year of Olympiad CCVI (AD 45), and notes the length of the island as 30 stadia (5.5 km). Orosius (writing early in the fifth century AD) dates it to the fifth year of Claudius (AD 45-46).\r\n<P>Since Aurelis Victor mentions that it happened on the same night as a lunar eclipse, there is a chance of dating the eruption accurately. Schove and Fletcher (1987, 9-11) derive several dates, noting that the most popular is 31 December AD 46, because this would embrace both Seneca's date of AD 46 and Dio's of AD 47. However, he thinks that 6 July AD 46 is more probable because the eclipse would have been distinctly noticeable by about 8.53 pm, and consequently more likely to be recorded.\r\n<P>Modern cataloguers associated this eruption with the Crete earthquake of 62-64, dating it 53/52/66.

The most energetic phase of the eruption (1147 UTC on May 29) was brief, lasting about 10 minutes based on seismic records on adjacent Sarigan and Anatahan Islands, sending an ash and gas cloud perhaps as high as 40,000 ft above sea level. The eruption was preceded by two moderate earthquakes and many smaller shocks; a moderate earthquake of magnitude approximately 4.8 accompanied the eruption. The eruption cloud drifted to the south, eventually passing over Guam, but no fallout was reported on Guam or Saipan. Following the short-lived explosion, activity appears to have ceased.\r\n<P>Evidence of submarine volcanic activity was first observed late on May 28 during aerial observations by a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Emergency Management Office (EMO) technician who noted an elongate patch of discolored ocean water and possible light-colored floating debris about 5 miles south of Sarigan Island. AVO seismologists noted tremor on nearby seismic stations about the same time. On May 29, satellite image analysis by the National Weather Service in Guam indicated that the area of disturbance had grown significantly in size prior to the 1147 UTC explosion. Within hours of the eruption, seismic activity began to wane, and after May 31, only a few scattered seismic events continue to be recorded. \r\n<P>The exact location of the active vent is still uncertain. The most likely source is the general summit area of a conical volcanic seamount located about 7 miles south of Sarigan Island. \r\n<P>A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service research crew camped on Sarigan Island during the eruption reported many felt earthquakes prior to the eruption and an explosion like 'thunder' accompanying the event. They also heard increasing wave activity during the night that may have been associated with the eruption; subsequently, a minor ash fall occurred. The NOAA West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center reported a possible 2-inch high tsunami related to this event may have been recorded on a tide gauge in Saipan.

The volcano Matavanu on the island of Savaii (Samoan Islands) was active between August 4, 1905, and November. Huge streams of lava up to one cubic km in volume emerged, one of which moved in a northeasterly direction and reached the ocean shore, a distance 12 km from the crater on December 6, 1905. Fields and villages situated in the path of the lava stream were destroyed. From time to time the lava tongues fell into the water and gave rise to small tsunami-type waves (including at the end of 1906 and in 1907). One of the phases of the eruption was observed by the missionary, John Farlong. According to his account, after some periods marked by earth tremors, on August 4, 1908, two yawning fissures appeared from which clouds of steam, illuminated by flames and eruptive material, shot up with explosive force. The streams of lava moved at a rate of 900 m (1/2 mile) in a 24 hour period, and at the points where the lava fell into the sea huge columns of steam rose, several times in the same area. They were 450 m (500 yards) in length and inundated the land for a distance of 90-110 m (100-120 yards). According to observers, the appearance of the waves coincided with increasing volcanic activity. (reference #415)\r\n<P>The Matavanu volcano on Savai'i Island began erupting on August 4, 1905.

There was a volcanic eruption in Unimak Pass. It is described by Captain Neville, of the whaler Alice Fraser. Crossing Unimak Pass on his ship with six other whalers, he observed an enormous mass of dense black smoke from a volcanic eruption on the adjacent islands. The ships were becalmed, leaving them exposed to the danger of the eruption. After twelve hours, a light breeze enabled the ships to begin moving away in the pitch blackness. Sailing west and north of the eastern shore they were near the northern base of the volcano when a prolonged dull rumble was heard and an underwater eruption began almost under the flotilla. The water churned and began to rise stormily in the form of disorganized waves. Then it rushed up, as if ejected from an enormous spring, forming a dazzling column of water of colossal height. A shaft of fire and smoke rose from the depths, with peals of thunder. Volcanic ejecta, the size of walnuts to cannon balls, landed on the ships. This phase ended quickly and water rushed into the abyss forming a colossal whirlpool. The ships escaped. The volcano was Mount Shihsaldin. As this is a report taken from American sources the date is Gregorian. None of the effects describe organized wave action, and this is probably not a tsunami report. Validity 1 (Reference #239).\r\n<P>1856, July 26. There was a violent eruption in Unimak Pass, apparently near 54 deg 35 min N., 165 deg W.

A powerful eruption of Shishaldin Volcano on Unimak Island began at the end of 1824 with the sound of explosions being heard from the Alaska Peninsula to Unalaska. The ashes and water mixed with rubble inundated the southern coast of the island for a distance of 2 miles. The report that the sea was agitated six months later, and the lack of reports of waves at the time of the main eruption, casts doubt on this as a report of a tsunami. This account in Soloviev and Go (1975) that was taken from Perry (1865) forty years later is in error regarding the data. Veniaminov (1984, p. 18) reports: \r\n<P>\"On March 10, 1825 [Julian date] after a loud subterranean thunder very similar to a cannonade, which lasted almost the whole day and was audible on Unalaska, Akum, and the tip of Aliaksa [the Alaska Peninsula] in the middle of the day, the northeast range of Unimak exploded in five or more places and over a large area with an eruption of flames and a great quantity of black ash which covered the whole end of Aliaksa for several inches. At nearby Aliaksa and especially Morzhevskoi settlement, it was dark for 3 or 4 hours. On this occasion the ice and snow lying on the range melted and for several days flowed in a dreadful river, 5 to 10 verst wide [3.3 to 6.6 miles; a verst is 0.6624 miles].

The 2857-m-high, glacier-covered volcano is the westernmost of three large stratovolcanoes along an E-W line in the eastern half of Unimak Island. A steady steam plume rises from its small summit crater. Constructed atop an older glacially dissected volcano, Shishaldin is Holocene in age and largely basaltic in composition. Remnants of an older ancestral volcano are exposed on the west and NE sides at 1500-1800 m elevation. Shishaldin contains over two dozen pyroclastic cones on its NW flank, which is blanketed by massive aa lava flows. Frequent explosive activity, primarily consisting of strombolian ash eruptions from the small summit crater, but sometimes producing lava flows, has been recorded since the 18th century (Reference #2432). \r\n<P>A powerful eruption of the Shishaldin volcano on Unimak Island began at the end of 1824. In the middle of March 1825, the sound of underground explosions was heard from Unalaska Island to the Alaska Peninsula. the volcano disgorged flames, ashes and streams of water, mixed with rubble, which inundated the southern coast of the island for 4 km (2 miles). The outpouring did not last long, but the sea was still agitated even in the following fall (Reference #414).", "DAMAGE_MILLIONS_DOLLARS": null, "DAMAGE_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "DAMAGE_DESCRIPTION": null, "DEATHS": null, "DEATHS_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "DEATHS_DESCRIPTION": null, "INJURIES": null, "INJURIES_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "INJURIES_DESCRIPTION": null, "MISSING": null, "MISSING_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "MISSING_DESCRIPTION": null, "HOUSES_DESTROYED": null, "HOUSES_AMOUNT_ORDER": null, "HOUSES_DESCRIPTION": null, "DAMAGE_MILLIONS_DOLLARS_TOTAL": null, "DAMAGE_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "DAMAGE_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "DEATHS_TOTAL": null, "DEATHS_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "DEATHS_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "INJURIES_TOTAL": null, "INJURIES_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "INJURIES_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "MISSING_TOTAL": null, "MISSING_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "MISSING_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "HOUSES_DESTROYED_TOTAL": null, "HOUSES_AMOUNT_ORDER_TOTAL": null, "HOUSES_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION": null, "SIGNIF": 1, "VALIDITY": null, "NUM": "1101-36-", "NAME": "Shishaldin", "LOCATION": "Aleutian Is", "LATITUDE": 54.75, "LONGITUDE": -163.97, "ELEVATION": 2857, "MORPHOLOGY": "Stratovolcano", "STATUS": "Historical", "TIME_ERUPT": "D1", "ID": 110136, "COUNTRY": "United States", "NUM_SLIDES": 0, "SIG_ID": null, "TSU_ID": 654, "HAZ_EVENT_ID": 3164, "OBJECTID": 1478 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -163.97, 54.75 ] } },

He said that the government on Friday allowed nearly 14,000 people living outside a three-mile danger zone to return home after the volcano's activity decreased. Mount Sinabung's morning eruption was followed by a more powerful blast that sent lava and pyroclastic flows down southern slopes up to 2.8 miles away, Nugroho said. Television footage showed villages, farms and trees around the 8,530-foot -high volcano covered in thick gray ash. Authorities were still preventing more than 16,000 villagers living along the path of hot clouds from going back to their homes, but many of them insisted on checking their houses and farms after more than four months of being crammed into temporary shelters.
